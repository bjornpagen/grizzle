 * A guard on a hook's own work: a layer's build, a setup or a teardown. Some waits in a hook are legal however long they
 * take, a wait for a resource other runs hold (a connection lease, a slot in a queue); some are a hang, a build stuck
 * on a server that never answers. A hook marks each wait for a shared resource with `waitingOnShared`, and the guard
 * counts only the time the hook spends outside every such wait, on the live clock: a hook whose own work outruns its
 * budget fails with LayerHung, its fiber stopped as a hung case's is, and a hook that waits on others for an hour
 * passes. Waits that overlap or nest are left out once: the hook is waiting while any of them is open.
